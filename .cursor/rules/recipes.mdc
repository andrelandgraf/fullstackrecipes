# fullstackrecipes (Full Stack Recipes)

fullstackrecipes.com provides cookbooks and recipes that help build better full-stack applications with AI-powered coding agents. Recipes are atomic instructions that follow a technical writing style using imperative steps (e.g., "Create xyz", "Download abc") without "you/we" pronouns.

## Terminology

- **Resources**: Documents an agent can read
- **Skills**: Instructions an agent always has access to, which can reference resources and other materials
- **Plugins** (Claude Code): Bundled collections of skills, MCP servers, and more for distribution
- **Tools**: Functions agents can call
- **Prompts**: Instructions for an agent, typically linking to resources and referencing MCP servers

## Content Types

### Recipes

Recipes are atomic, self-contained instructions. Each recipe serves one of two purposes:

1. **Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step guides to configure something in a repository
2. **Skills**: Instructions that teach agents how to work with previously configured tools or features

All recipe content is stored as markdown files in the `docs/recipes/` directory.

### Cookbooks

Cookbooks bundle multiple related recipes together, walking an agent through several setup guides and skills in sequence. For example, the "Base App Setup" cookbook includes recipes for setting up a base application with Next.js, Shadcn UI, Neon Postgres, Drizzle ORM, and AI SDK.

## Usage

1. Discover recipes and cookbooks of interest
2. Copy markdown content manually and pass to a coding agent, or
3. Install the MCP server to access recipes programmatically

Recipes can be selected and copied as markdown or accessed as MCP resources. Cookbooks can also be installed as Claude Code Plugins.

## Repository Structure

All metadata for recipes and cookbooks is stored in `/src/lib/recipes/data.tsx`.

Some code utilities are exposed through the shadcn registry stored in `/registry.json`. Run `bun run registry:build` to build the registry and generate files in `public/r/`.

## Demo Application

This repository includes a demo application that showcases the recipes and cookbooks in action. The demo app verifies guides are complete and accurate.

**Important**: Keep the demo app synchronized with the recipes and cookbooks. Code should ideally match 1-to-1 between recipes and the demo app.

Exceptions:

- Recipe code examples may include comments not present in the demo app
- Recipes may omit code that is implemented in later recipes

Always highlight discrepancies between recipe and demo code to determine what is out of sync (stale demo code or stale recipe examples).
