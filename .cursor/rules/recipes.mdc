# fullstackrecipes (Full Stack Recipes)

fullstackrecipes.com provides cookbooks and recipes that help build better full-stack applications with AI-powered coding agents. Recipes are atomic instructions that follow a technical writing style using imperative steps (e.g., "Create xyz", "Download abc") without "you/we" pronouns.

## Terminology

- **Resources**: Documents an agent can read
- **Skills**: Instructions an agent always has access to, which can reference resources and other materials
- **Plugins** (Claude Code): Bundled collections of skills, MCP servers, and more for distribution
- **Tools**: Functions agents can call
- **Prompts**: Instructions for an agent, typically linking to resources and referencing MCP servers

## Content Types

### Recipes

Recipes are atomic, self-contained instructions. Each recipe serves one of two purposes:

1. **Setup Instructions**: Step-by-step guides to configure something in a repository
2. **Skills**: Instructions that teach agents how to work with previously configured tools or features

All recipe content is stored as markdown files in the `docs/recipes/` directory.

#### Recipe Markdown Structure

**Setup Instructions** use numbered step headings:

```markdown
### Step 1: Install packages

### Step 2: Create the config file

### Step 3: Add environment variables
```

**How-To Guides** use descriptive section headings:

```markdown
### Writing Queries

### Inserting Data

### Using Relational Queries
```

**Common sections** (include when applicable):

- `## File Structure` - Show the resulting directory layout after setup
- `## Usage` - Provide common usage patterns and examples
- `## References` - Link to external documentation at the end

Use horizontal rules (`---`) to separate major sections.

#### Code Block Formatting

When a code block represents file content, the first line must be a comment with the file path:

```typescript
// src/lib/example/config.ts
import { something } from "./somewhere";

export const config = { ... };
```

This convention helps agents understand which file to create or modify. Use the appropriate comment syntax for the language (`//` for TypeScript/JavaScript, `#` for shell scripts, etc.).

**Language tags by content type:**

- `typescript` / `ts` / `tsx` - TypeScript/React code
- `bash` - Terminal commands
- `env` - Environment variable examples
- `json` - Configuration files (no file path comment needed for snippets)

#### Writing Conventions

- Use imperative steps: "Create the config file" not "You should create..."
- Avoid "you/we" pronouns throughout
- Use `>` blockquotes for Notes and Tips: `> **Note**: This requires...`
- Cross-reference other recipes with relative links: `[Environment Variable Management](/recipes/env-management)`

#### Recipe Metadata (data.tsx)

Each recipe in `/src/lib/recipes/data.tsx` requires:

- `slug` - URL-safe identifier matching the markdown filename (without `.md`)
- `title` - Display name
- `description` - One-sentence summary
- `tags` - Array containing one of: `"Setup Instructions"`, `"Skills"`, `"Cookbooks"`, or `"Starter template"`
- `icon` - Lucide icon component
- `previewCode` - Representative code snippet for OG images (no file path comments)

Optional fields:

- `requires` - Array of prerequisite recipe slugs
- `registryDeps` - Array of shadcn registry item names from `registry.json`
- `isCookbook` / `recipes` / `template` / `githubUrl` - For cookbooks only

### Cookbooks

Cookbooks bundle multiple related recipes together, walking an agent through several setup guides and skills in sequence. For example, the "Base App Setup" cookbook includes recipes for setting up a base application with Next.js, Shadcn UI, Neon Postgres, Drizzle ORM, and AI SDK.

## Usage

1. Discover recipes and cookbooks of interest
2. Copy markdown content manually and pass to a coding agent, or
3. Install the MCP server to access recipes programmatically

Recipes can be selected and copied as markdown or accessed as MCP resources. Cookbooks can also be installed as Claude Code Plugins.

## Repository Structure

All metadata for recipes and cookbooks is stored in `/src/lib/recipes/data.tsx`.

Some code utilities are exposed through the shadcn registry stored in `/registry.json`. Run `bun run registry:build` to build the registry and generate files in `public/r/`.

## Demo Application

This repository includes a demo application that showcases the recipes and cookbooks in action. The demo app verifies guides are complete and accurate.

**Important**: Keep the demo app synchronized with the recipes and cookbooks. Code should ideally match 1-to-1 between recipes and the demo app.

Exceptions:

- Recipe code examples may include comments not present in the demo app
- Recipes may omit code that is implemented in later recipes

Always highlight discrepancies between recipe and demo code to determine what is out of sync (stale demo code or stale recipe examples).
